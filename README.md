One player is the seeker, the rest are hiders. Last hider caught gets a point. Everyone becomes a seeker once, afterward game ends. At end, everyone is given points decreasing from `player_count - 1` based on their seek time placement (fastest seeker gets `player_count - 1` points, second fastest gets `player_count - 2` points, etc.)
